## Introduction

Firstly, my main goal for this app was to recreate my very own Tamagotchi app for android where users can play feed 
and clean their virtual pet while keeping an eye on their health hunger and cleanliness. So in other words the purpose of the 
Tamagotchi app is to provide users with an engaging and interactive experience of taking care of a virtual pet. My app features a 
welcome page which then leads users into the game, where they have the option to play, feed, and clean their virtual pet while 
keeping a close eye on yours pets health, hunger and cleanliness status. 

Moreover, my apps user interface was designed to be simple yet engaging and welcoming incorporating images of your pet on the 
welcome page and making it give a unique feel. Furthermore, the pets image will change according to what action it is performing 
for example when you click the feed button it should reflect this action.

In addition, I have made this application easy to use and navigate, with clear instructions and feedback for the user. 
Also the petâ€™s status should be easily visible and understandable, and the user should be able to quickly perform action to care 
for their pet.

However here are more images of the application working
